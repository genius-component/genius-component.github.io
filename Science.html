<div class="question-container" id="question1">
  <p>Throughout most of the 1800s, sea otters were hunted to near-extinction all along the Pacific coast of North America. How did this impact those ecosystems?</p>
  <input type="text" id="answer1" placeholder="Type your answer here">
  <button onclick="checkAnswer(1)">Submit</button>
  <p id="correct1" class="answer">As otters disappeared due to overhunting, urchin populations exploded because there were fewer otters around to eat them.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="question-container hidden" id="question2">
  <p>Glaucous-winged gulls are common seabirds along the northwest Pacific coast of North America. They are omnivores that primarily consume fish and marine invertebrates,
      but they will also eat the eggs and chicks of other birds. What happened to their diet when otters disappeared?</p>
  <input type="text" id="answer2" placeholder="Type your answer here">
  <button onclick="checkAnswer(2)">Submit</button>
  <p id="correct2" class="answer">In the absence of otters, and the resulting loss of kelp forests, gull diets shifted from mainly fish to mainly invertebrates.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-container hidden" id="question3">
  <p>Once endangered because of human activities, bald eagle populations have recovered to the point that they are no longer classified as endangered or threatened. 
     Bald eagles specialize in eating fish, but they are opportunistic raptors and will include small mammals as well as other birds in their diet.</p>
  <p>What happened to their diet when otters disappeared?</p>
  <input type="text" id="answer" placeholder="Type your answer here">
  <button onclick="checkAnswer(3)">Submit</button>
  <p id="correct3" class="answer">Bald eagle diets shifted toward eating more birds and fewer mammals as a result of a changed habitat. This and the gull example illustrate how effects from species loss can be transmitted through the entire ecosystem.</p>
